# marketing-page-playground
https://tahireu.github.io/marketing-page-playground/
The main goal is to have the framer motion experiment for the RV Marketing page up and running ASAP, so please ignore the code being a complete mess

### `nvm use 14`
As I said, the code is a mess, so I'm using an old version of node, you can use nvm to switch to it. **You'll maybe need to install yarn for the Node 14.**

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
